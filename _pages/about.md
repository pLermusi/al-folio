I am currently working as a Research Engineer for Inria, in the [Epicure](https://team.inria.fr/epicure/) team, at the [Brittany Center](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university) associated with [Université de Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes.fr/). I mainly work on the [Salto project](https://salto.gitlabpages.inria.fr/), which goal is to provide a static analyser for OCaml programs based on Abstract Interpretation.

As of September 2020, I am a PhD graduate in computer science from [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr). I did my thesis at [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr), under the supervision of [Horatiu Cirstea](https://members.loria.fr/HCirstea) and [Pierre-Etienne Moreau](https://sites.google.com/a/depinfonancy.net/pem), on static analysis methods to guarantee algebraic properties on program transformations using a formalism based on term rewrite systems and pattern-matching.

My scientific interests vary from formal studies of program transformations and applications of the rewrite formalisms, to static analysis techniques. I may dabble into a bit of distributed algorithms and parallel programming paradigms whenever I get the opportunity.

Personal interests include Badminton, Scuba-diving (and eventual associated travels), hiking and a little bit of Piano practice (although my talent is pretty limited).
