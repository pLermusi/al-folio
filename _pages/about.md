I am a PhD Student in computer science at [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr) in the [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr), advised by [Horatiu Cirstea](https://members.loria.fr/HCirstea) and [Pierre-Etienne Moreau](https://sites.google.com/a/depinfonancy.net/pem). I am working on static analysis methods to guarantee algebraic properties on program transformations using a formalism based on term rewrite systems and pattern-matching.

My scientific interests varies from formal studies of program transformations, applications of the rewrite formalisms to static analysis techniques. I may dabble into a bit of distributed algorithms and parallel programming paradigms whenever I get the opportunity.

Personal interests includes Badminton, Scuba-diving (and eventual associated travels), hiking and a little bit of Piano practice (though my talent is pretty modest).
